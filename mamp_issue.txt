Apologies for the confusion. On macOS, you can install PHP and Composer using Homebrew. Here are the steps to install PHP and Composer on macOS:

Install Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Install PHP by running the following command:
Copy code
brew install php


Install Composer by running the following command:
Copy code
brew install composer

Once PHP and Composer are installed, make sure their binary files are in your PATH. You can check if the binary files are in your PATH by running the echo $PATH command in your terminal. The output should include the directories where PHP and Composer are installed.

If the binary files are not in your PATH, add their directories to your PATH. You can do this by adding the following lines to your shell profile file (e.g., ~/.bash_profile):

Copy code
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
Save and close the shell profile file, and reload it by running the following command:


Copy code
source ~/.bash_profile

Test that PHP and Composer are now in your PATH by running the following commands:
Copy code
php -v
composer -v
